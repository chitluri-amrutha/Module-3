      <p>The strategy I had developed was matching the best practices that these influencers were using.I asked several of my friends to give the process a try as well. Again, success!I don’t share any of this to toot my own horn. I tell you this, because there is a proven way to expand your LinkedIn influence through high-engaging techniques.If you follow the process, you can increase your engagement levels on LinkedIn.If your success rate is anything like my friend, you can get as high as 78% of your network to engage with a single post!But that’s a misguided approach! The real value on LinkedIn is not the number of people in the network, but the influence that you possess within your network.It’s easy to look at a big network size and think, “Wow. That person is important!”<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
